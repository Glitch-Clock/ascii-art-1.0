# ASCII Art Image Converter

## Overview
This program converts images into ASCII art and saves the result as a new image file. It utilizes the `stb_image.h` for image loading and `stb_image_write.h` for saving the converted image.

## Requirements
To run the program, make sure to include the following header files:
- `stb_image.h` (for image loading)
- `stb_image_write.h` (for writing the output image)

These headers are part of the **STB Master** library, which can be found in my repository. Be sure to download and include them in your project.

## Instructions

1. **Download the required files** from the [stb-master repository](link-to-your-repository).
2. **Compile and link** the source code:
   - Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies for compiling C programs, including the libraries for image loading and saving.
3. **Run the Program**:
   - Simply **drag and drop** the image you want to convert onto the executable.
   - The program will generate an ASCII art version of the image and save it as a new image file in the same directory as the executable.

## Features
- **Automatic Image Conversion**: Convert any image into an ASCII art representation.
- **Output**: The ASCII art is saved in the same directory, with a new image generated.
